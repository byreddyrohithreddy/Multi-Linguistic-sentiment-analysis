In this method featureset from the hindi corpus based method is taken, later a neural network model is created using 1 dimensional convolution neural network with 3 hidden layers using. Convolutional neural networks are composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons. Artificial neurons, a rough imitation of their biological counterparts, are mathematical functions that calculate the weighted sum of multiple inputs and output an activation value Convolution Neural Networks are mainly used for images but a 1-dimensional convolution can be used for language processing. featureset is passed to a CNN. The featureset matrix is passed to the embedding layer. 64 is chosen for output filters and kernel size of 4 is chosen which specifies the length of the convolution window. ReLu activation function is used for the 1D convolutional neural network. MaxPooling1D
Multi Linguistic Sentiment Analysis DEPT OF CSE,MVSREC 22 layers are applied to each layer. All the outputs are then concatenated. A Dropout layer then Dense then Dropout and then Final Dense layer is applied. Same ReLu activation function is used for the first dense layer and the activation function for the second layer is sigmoid
